                    <li>What is an EMI?</li>
                    <br>
                    <p>The Equated Monthly Instalment (or EMI) consists of the principal portion of the loan amount and the interest. Therefore, EMI = principal amount + interest paid on the personal loan. The EMI, usually, remains fixed for the entire tenure of your loan, and it is to be repaid over the tenure of the loan on a monthly basis.
                       <br>
                        Mathematically, EMI is calculated as under:
                        <br>
                        P x R x (1+R)^N / [(1+R)^N-1]
                        <br>
                        P = Principal amount of the loan
                        <br>
                        R = Rate of interest
                        <br>
                        N = Number of monthly instalments.
                        <br>
                        So, say you are applying for a personal loan, amounting to Rs 2,00,000 at a rate of interest of 15.5% p.a. and your loan tenure is 2 years, your EMI will be calculated as under:
                        <br>
                        EMI = 200000* 0.0129 * (1+ 0.0129)^24 = Rs 9,745 / [(1+ 0.0129)^24 ]-1
                        <br>
                        The rate of interest (R) on your loan is calculated monthly i.e. (R= Annual rate of interest/12/100). For instance, if R = 15.5% per annum, then R= 15.5/12/100 = 0.0129.
                        <br>
